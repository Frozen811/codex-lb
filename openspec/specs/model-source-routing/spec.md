# Model Source Routing Specification

## Purpose

Define capability-based routing and accounting for OpenAI-compatible model sources, including field-preserving embeddings forwarding.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Model sources declare an embeddings capability

Each model source MUST carry a persisted `supports_embeddings` boolean
capability flag. The flag MUST default to disabled, so a source created or
migrated without an explicit value MUST NOT be treated as embeddings-capable.
The model-source create, read, and update contracts MUST expose the flag, and
the stored value MUST survive a round trip through those contracts.

#### Scenario: existing sources default to disabled

- **GIVEN** a model source row that predates the embeddings capability
- **WHEN** the schema migration runs
- **THEN** the source reports `supports_embeddings` as disabled
- **AND** its existing chat-completions, responses, and audio-transcription
  routing is unchanged

#### Scenario: capability round-trips through the API

- **WHEN** a client creates or updates a model source with the embeddings
  capability enabled
- **THEN** reading the source back reports the capability as enabled

#### Scenario: omitted capability parses as disabled

- **WHEN** a model-source payload omits `supports_embeddings`
- **THEN** it parses as disabled rather than failing validation

### Requirement: Embeddings route only to capable model sources

The system SHALL expose `POST /v1/embeddings` and MUST serve it only from an
enabled model source of kind `openai_compatible` that declares the embeddings
capability and has the requested model enabled. Embeddings requests MUST NOT
fall back to subscription-backed accounts. When the caller presents an API key
restricted to a set of sources, selection MUST stay inside that set. Beyond
the validated `model` and `input` fields, the request payload MUST be
forwarded to the source verbatim.

#### Scenario: capable source serves the request

- **GIVEN** an enabled model source declaring the embeddings capability with
  the requested model enabled
- **WHEN** a client posts to `/v1/embeddings`
- **THEN** the proxy forwards the payload to that source's `/embeddings`
  endpoint and returns the upstream JSON response

#### Scenario: no capable source is a model error

- **GIVEN** no enabled model source declares the embeddings capability for
  the requested model
- **WHEN** a client posts to `/v1/embeddings`
- **THEN** the proxy returns 404 with an OpenAI-format error envelope using
  code `model_not_found`
- **AND** the request is not routed to a subscription-backed account

#### Scenario: source-restricted API key cannot escape its set

- **GIVEN** an API key restricted to a set of model sources
- **WHEN** the only embeddings-capable source for the model is outside that
  set
- **THEN** the proxy returns `model_not_found`

### Requirement: Embeddings requests are accounted like other source routes

Embeddings responses MUST be inspected for prompt and total token usage. When
the caller's API key requires usage for settlement and the source response
reports none, the proxy MUST fail closed with `usage_unavailable` rather than
serving unmetered traffic. Every embeddings attempt that is dispatched to a
model source MUST produce a request-log entry, with `success` on a forwarded
response and `error` on a forwarding, usage, or settlement failure. That entry
MUST carry the upstream status code when a source returned an HTTP response,
and MUST record the upstream status as absent when the attempt failed before
any response was received. A request rejected before source selection succeeds
is not a dispatched attempt: it MUST NOT produce a request-log entry, because
no source was contacted and no reservation was consumed.

#### Scenario: missing usage fails closed for a limited key

- **GIVEN** an API key whose reservation requires reported usage
- **WHEN** the model source returns an embeddings response without a usage
  object
- **THEN** the proxy returns an error envelope using code `usage_unavailable`
- **AND** records an error request log

#### Scenario: forwarding error propagates the upstream status

- **WHEN** the model source returns an error status for an embeddings request
- **THEN** the proxy returns an OpenAI-format error envelope with that status
- **AND** records an error request log carrying the upstream status code

#### Scenario: transport failure records an attempt without an upstream status

- **WHEN** the request to the model source fails before any HTTP response is
  received
- **THEN** the proxy records an error request log for the attempt with no
  upstream status code

#### Scenario: unroutable model is not a logged attempt

- **GIVEN** no enabled model source declares the embeddings capability for
  the requested model
- **WHEN** a client posts to `/v1/embeddings`
- **THEN** the proxy returns the `model_not_found` envelope without writing a
  request-log entry
- **AND** no reservation is consumed for the rejected request

### Requirement: Embeddings source forwarding preserves field presence

For source-routed `POST /v1/embeddings` requests, the system MUST preserve both
the values and presence of fields beyond the validated `model` and `input`
fields. A field explicitly supplied as null MUST be forwarded as null, a field
omitted by the client MUST remain absent, and a non-null field MUST be forwarded
unchanged. This forwarding behavior MUST NOT change reservation settlement or
request-log metadata.

#### Scenario: explicit null extras remain present

- **WHEN** a client supplies `dimensions: null` and `user: null` in a
  source-routed embeddings request
- **THEN** the compatible source receives both keys with null values

#### Scenario: omitted extras remain absent

- **WHEN** a client omits `dimensions` and `user` from a source-routed
  embeddings request
- **THEN** the compatible source payload does not contain either key

#### Scenario: non-null extras and accounting remain unchanged

- **WHEN** a client supplies non-null embedding extras through a limited API
  key
- **THEN** the compatible source receives those values unchanged
- **AND** the reservation settles from reported usage
- **AND** the successful request log retains its model-source metadata and
  token counts

### Requirement: Owner-unavailable stream health preserves the recovery cause

The service SHALL use the original upstream error code for account-health
recovery when a Responses stream rewrites an upstream failure to
`previous_response_owner_unavailable`. The rewrite MUST NOT change
source-ownership selection, owner pinning, or stale-anchor matching.

#### Scenario: Owner-unavailable rewrite records original recovery code

- **WHEN** an upstream Responses failure with an account-recovery code is
  rewritten to `previous_response_owner_unavailable`
- **THEN** account health receives the original upstream code
- **AND** source ownership and stale-anchor classification remain unchanged

### Requirement: Model sources declare plan availability for ChatGPT OAuth consumers

When constructing upstream model descriptors from configured Model Sources, the catalog builder SHALL populate `available_in_plans` from the source model's metadata when present, and SHALL default to all standard ChatGPT plan types (`free`, `plus`, `pro`, `team`, `edu`) when omitted or empty, enabling ChatGPT OAuth users in Codex Desktop to access model source models.

#### Scenario: Custom model source defaults to standard ChatGPT plans
- **GIVEN** an enabled model source with no explicit plan restrictions in metadata
- **WHEN** the model catalog is projected for Codex clients
- **THEN** each model entry includes standard ChatGPT plans in `available_in_plans`
- **AND** Codex Desktop client-side plan validation allows the model for ChatGPT accounts

### Requirement: CLIProxyAPI catalog discovery and unavailable model ownership retention

Model sources configured with external catalog discovery (CLIProxyAPI) MUST support automated catalog synchronization and unavailable model ownership retention:
1. When catalog synchronization runs, the source SHALL query the provider's `/v1/models` catalog.
2. In the event of an upstream outage, the system SHALL preserve the last successfully observed model catalog snapshot.
3. Models omitted from an upstream catalog update MUST be retained in the model registry marked as unavailable rather than removed. Requests for omitted models MUST return model unavailability errors rather than falling through to native subscription accounts.

#### Scenario: Unreachable catalog preserves last known snapshot
- **GIVEN** a model source with a cached catalog snapshot
- **WHEN** the external catalog endpoint is temporarily unreachable
- **THEN** the model registry retains the existing model snapshot without dropping models

#### Scenario: Omitted external model retains ownership and rejects fallback
- **GIVEN** a model previously registered to an external model source
- **WHEN** an updated catalog snapshot omits that model
- **THEN** the model is retained as unavailable
- **AND** client requests for that model do not route to subscription accounts
